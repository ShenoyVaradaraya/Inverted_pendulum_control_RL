Final Project: Solving the Inverted Pendulum Control Problem using Reinforcement Learning 

Authors : Aalap Doshi, Poojan Patel, Varadaraya Ganesh Shenoy.

For the code to run successfully , please make sure the to have tensorflow, python 3.7 and OpenAI Gym. 

This code is executed on Python 3.7 with tensorflow at backend. 
To run the code successfully following libraries should be imported :
1)tensorflow <= 1.1
2)matplotlib>=2.0
3)gym>=0.9.3
4)numpy
5)seaborn   

Mathematical equations can been seen in the report and also the Two-Single Layer Network used in the code is discussed in the report.  
The code should be allowed to run for all the epochs for getting better output in the graph and stabilization of the cart pole system.
If stopped midway it will generate an error because of the agent parameters missing .
The model is named by main.py  . 
The results and the analysis is presented in Report.pdf.

2 videos are added as output from our code in which it can be seen how the cart system balances itself. One video called failure.mp4 shows how controller fails to balance while success.mp4 depicts balancing the pendulum perfectly.
